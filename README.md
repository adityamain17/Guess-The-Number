# 🎯 Guess the Number Game

This is my **first Python project** — a command-line game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

## 🛠️ Features

- Random number is generated using `randint`
- User is prompted to guess until the correct number is found
- Gives hints to guess higher or lower
- Counts the number of attempts

## 📂 File Info

- `main.py` – Contains the game logic

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python main.py


💡 What I Learned
>How to generate random numbers using random.randint()

>Taking input from users using input()

>Using if, elif, and else for decision-making

>Implementing loops using for to give limited attempts

>Using a variable (attempt) to count number of tries

>Giving hints to the user whether to guess higher or lower

>Breaking the loop using break when the correct guess is made
